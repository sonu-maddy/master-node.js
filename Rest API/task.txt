REST API------
ðŸ‘‰ Representational State Transfer

ðŸ”¹ Explanation

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation.

REST uses simple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points

Representational â†’ Data (resource) is represented in formats like JSON, XML, or HTML.

State â†’ The resource's state (data) is transferred between client and server.

Transfer â†’ The actual movement of this representation happens over HTTP.

ðŸ”¹ Example in REST API

If we have a "users" resource:

GET /users â†’ fetch all users

GET /users/1 â†’ fetch user with id = 1

POST /users â†’ create a new user

PUT /users/1 â†’ update user with id = 1

DELETE /users/1 â†’ delete user with id = 1
