Versioning in Node.js primarily refers to two distinct but related concepts:
Node.js Runtime Versioning:
This involves managing the specific version of the Node.js runtime environment used for a project or across multiple projects 
on a single machine. Tools like nvm (Node Version Manager) are commonly used for this purpose, allowing developers to easily install, 
switch between, and manage different Node.js versions. 
This ensures compatibility with project requirements and allows testing against various Node.js environments.

Application/API Versioning (Semantic Versioning - SemVer):
This refers to the versioning of your own Node.js applications or APIs, especially when dealing with public-facing APIs or
 libraries. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is the standard practice, using a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format:

MAJOR: Incremented for breaking changes (incompatible API changes).
MINOR: Incremented for adding new functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
PATCH: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

This versioning is typically managed in the package.json file for Node.js projects and 
 communicated to consumers of your API or library. For APIs, common implementation strategies include:

URL-based versioning: Incorporating the version number directly in the URL (e.g., /api/v1/users).

Header-based versioning: Using a custom header to specify the desired API version (e.g., API-Version: 1).

Query parameter versioning: Including the version as a query parameter (e.g., /api/users?version=1).


-------example-------

version 

-- 4.18.3

1st Part -> 4
2nd Part -> 18
3rd Part -> 2

// 3rd part (last part ) - Minor Fixed (optional)
Latest -> 4.18.2 

// 2nd Part - Recommended Bug Fix (secure fix)
Latest - 4.19.1

// 3rd Part (Major Release) 
Latest - 5



Common Symbols and Their Meanings:
Caret ^:
The caret symbol allows for updates to the minor and patch versions, but locks the major version. This means that ^1.2.3 will allow versions like 1.2.4, 1.3.0, or 1.9.9, but not 2.0.0. For versions with a major version of 0 (e.g., ^0.2.3), it behaves more like a tilde, allowing only patch updates within that minor version (e.g., 0.2.4 but not 0.3.0).
Tilde ~:
The tilde symbol allows for updates only to the patch version, locking both the major and minor versions. For example, ~1.2.3 will allow versions like 1.2.4, but not 1.3.0.
Exact Version (no symbol):
Specifying a version without any symbol, such as "1.2.3", means that only that exact version will be installed.
Wildcard *:
The wildcard symbol allows any version of the package to be installed. This is generally not recommended for production environments due to potential for breaking changes.
Greater Than/Less Than >, <, >=, <=, =:
These symbols allow for specifying a range of versions. For example, >1.0.0 means any version greater than 1.0.0, while >=1.0.0 <2.0.0 specifies a range from 1.0.0 up to (but not including) 2.0.0.
Hyphen -:
Used to define a range between two specific versions, inclusive. For example, 1.0.0 - 2.0.0 allows any version from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0. 
These symbols, particularly the caret and tilde, leverage semantic versioning (SemVer) principles to manage dependency updates while balancing stability and the incorporation of new features and bug fixes.
